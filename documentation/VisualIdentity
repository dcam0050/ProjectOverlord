For what you want – “sick professional but somewhat playful” – the stack you should lean on is:

Material 3 (M3) theming

A custom color scheme (not just the default purple)

Rounded shapes + subtle motion for the playful bit

Clean typography + lots of whitespace for the professional bit

I’ll give you:

What concepts to use in Compose (themes, tokens)

A concrete visual direction you can hand to LLMs/devs

Example MaterialTheme setup in code

A few “don’ts” so the app doesn’t look like a student project

1. The levers you actually have in Jetpack Compose

In Compose, your main visual dials are:

MaterialTheme.colorScheme

MaterialTheme.typography

MaterialTheme.shapes

Component style overrides (e.g. buttons, cards)

Motion: animate*AsState, transitions, navigation animations

Everything “pro” comes from consistent use of these, not inventing ad-hoc styles per screen.

Material 3 (you want this)

Use the Material 3 libraries (material3), not the old M2 ones. That gives you:

Color roles: primary, secondary, tertiary, surface, background, outline, error…

Built-in dark/light theming

Components that already look modern if you don’t butcher them.

You define a light and dark ColorScheme and pass it into MaterialTheme.

2. Visual direction for “professional but playful”

Let’s make this concrete so you can brief an LLM:

Color strategy

Base palette: cool/neutral for the serious part

Backgrounds: near-white → very dark grey

Surfaces: subtle elevation (light greys)

Accent palette: slightly neon / saturated for the playful part

primary: an electric teal or blue-green

secondary: a soft purple/magenta

tertiary: warm accent (salmon/orange) reserved for special CTAs or warnings-that-aren’t-errors

Conceptually:

Professional: the background, text, card surfaces

Playful: the primary/secondary accents, micro-animations, and icons

Shapes

Use rounded corners, but don’t go full bubble-gum:

Cards: 16–20 dp corner radius

Buttons: 20–24 dp

TextFields/Chips: pill-shaped for key actions

Typography

One serious, clean typeface (e.g. the default Roboto / Google Sans if available) with:

Big, bold headlines (24–32sp)

Medium-weight subheadings

Body text at 14–16sp, high line height

The “playful” comes more from layout + color + icons than from silly fonts.

Motion

Subtle, not carnival:

Slight scale/alpha on button press

Fade/slide transitions between screens

Animated numbers/times when alarms change

3. Example: Theme spec you can hand to devs/LLMs

Here’s a starting point for your theme definition (pseudo-brand, tweak values as you like):

// Colors
val md_theme_light_primary = Color(0xFF00B8D9)   // Electric teal
val md_theme_light_onPrimary = Color(0xFFFFFFFF)
val md_theme_light_secondary = Color(0xFF7B61FF) // Playful purple
val md_theme_light_onSecondary = Color(0xFFFFFFFF)
val md_theme_light_tertiary = Color(0xFFFF9F66)  // Warm accent (sparingly)
val md_theme_light_background = Color(0xFF0B0C10) // Very dark for hero screens OR flip if you prefer light
val md_theme_light_surface = Color(0xFF11141C)
val md_theme_light_onBackground = Color(0xFFE6ECFF)
val md_theme_light_onSurface = Color(0xFFE6ECFF)
val md_theme_light_outline = Color(0xFF2E3340)

// Dark theme could invert or tweak these; just keep contrast high.


Then your ColorScheme:

private val LightColorScheme = lightColorScheme(
    primary = md_theme_light_primary,
    onPrimary = md_theme_light_onPrimary,
    secondary = md_theme_light_secondary,
    onSecondary = md_theme_light_onSecondary,
    tertiary = md_theme_light_tertiary,
    background = Color(0xFFF7F8FC),
    onBackground = Color(0xFF11141C),
    surface = Color(0xFFFFFFFF),
    onSurface = Color(0xFF11141C),
    outline = Color(0xFFCBD2E0),
    error = Color(0xFFB00020),
    onError = Color.White,
)


Shapes:

val AppShapes = Shapes(
    extraSmall = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp),
    small = RoundedCornerShape(12.dp),
    medium = RoundedCornerShape(16.dp),
    large = RoundedCornerShape(24.dp),  // Cards, bottom sheets
    extraLarge = RoundedCornerShape(32.dp) // Special hero cards, big CTAs
)


Typography (rough sketch):

val AppTypography = Typography(
    headlineLarge = TextStyle(
        fontSize = 32.sp,
        fontWeight = FontWeight.SemiBold,
        letterSpacing = 0.sp
    ),
    headlineMedium = TextStyle(
        fontSize = 24.sp,
        fontWeight = FontWeight.SemiBold
    ),
    titleMedium = TextStyle(
        fontSize = 18.sp,
        fontWeight = FontWeight.Medium
    ),
    bodyLarge = TextStyle(
        fontSize = 16.sp,
        fontWeight = FontWeight.Normal,
        lineHeight = 22.sp
    ),
    bodyMedium = TextStyle(
        fontSize = 14.sp,
        fontWeight = FontWeight.Normal,
        lineHeight = 20.sp
    ),
    labelLarge = TextStyle(
        fontSize = 14.sp,
        fontWeight = FontWeight.SemiBold
    )
)


And the theme:

@Composable
fun TransitAlarmTheme(
    darkTheme: Boolean = isSystemInDarkTheme(),
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    val colorScheme = if (darkTheme) DarkColorScheme else LightColorScheme

    MaterialTheme(
        colorScheme = colorScheme,
        typography = AppTypography,
        shapes = AppShapes,
        content = content
    )
}


After that, everything in your app uses MaterialTheme:

Buttons: Button(colors = ButtonDefaults.buttonColors(containerColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary))

Backgrounds: Modifier.background(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background)

Cards: shape = MaterialTheme.shapes.large

That’s how you keep it cohesive.

4. Specific visual guidelines for your app

Give LLM workers something like this:

Primary layout style

Lots of vertical spacing between sections (16–24dp)

Use Cards for “Journeys”, “Alarms”, “Profiles”

Max 1–2 accent colors per screen

Home / Planner screen

Top hero area:

Big text: “Where are you going?”

Subtext in secondary color

Two cards:

Origin card (chip-style: “Use current location” + address text)

Destination card (text field with icon)

Primary CTA button in primary color, full-width, rounded

Alarm summary screen

Timeline style:

Vertical line (outline color)

Dots for each alarm (primary color)

Each alarm is a card with:

Big time (e.g., “07:40”)

Label (“Leave for Paddington train”)

Profile chip (Spotify icon + playlist name)

Full-screen alarm

Dark/low-distraction background (e.g. background or a gradient using primary+secondary)

Center:

Huge time & label

Bottom:

Large pill buttons:

“Dismiss” (error/tertiary)

“Snooze” (secondary)

Background glow/accent ring behind main content for the “sick” look.

You can literally say to your LLM workers:

Use large cards with 16–24dp padding, 16–20dp corner radius, and minimal borders, relying on elevation and contrast instead of heavy outlines.

5. Things to explicitly forbid (so they don’t wreck the look)

Tell them not to:

Mix more than 3 main colors on a single screen.

Use all caps everywhere (keep it for small labels at most).

Add drop shadows on everything – use elevation sparingly.

Use multiple font families.

Use different corner radii arbitrarily; stick to MaterialTheme.shapes.
